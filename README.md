PyHaHa2 is a software project within the Particle Physics and Detector Development Group of the Universität
Hamburg, Institut für Experimentalpyhsik, http://wwwiexp.desy.de/groups/pd/.
It is the upwards compatible successor of the PyHaHa project.

The objective is to provide universal Python classes to analyze the data files created by the several Labview
programs (usually running under Windows XP). These Python classes can easily be adapted to specific neds and analyses.
Future expansions will be possible.
